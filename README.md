# BoltChain âš¡
*a peer to peer energy exchange focused on solar energy.*

By using a *BoltBox* one can sell/buy solar energy depending on ones current needs.
The energy is provided by solar energy producers that also participate in the network. 
This is done via a decentralized exchange to remove central exchanges like eex.
Trading your energy is now possible for everyone without compromise.
